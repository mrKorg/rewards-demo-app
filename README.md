# Frontend Project

## Description

The project is to create a page that displays "Rewards". The page will have tabs for all rewards and a separate tab for each different status type.

## Requirements

- Tabbed display with separate urls for each tab
- Ability to go to an edit page for each object (and persist edits locally)
- Add ability to sort, filter or search (Choose the fields you think are important)
- Do not use generators
- Write the logic which can migrate to web server instead of data.js easily

For technology, feel free to use any HTML/CSS framework you would like. On the Javascript end, stick with React/Redux stack (additional libraries allowed where you think it makes sense).
